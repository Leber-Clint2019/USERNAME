    My initial expectations of this course were that we were going to be doing a lot of coding with ones and zeros. I thought we were going to be programming applications and making programs that were games and stuff like that. Although we have made one game I thought The games we are going to be making we're going to be 3D. So all in all my expectations were not that far off. One programming experience that I enjoyed was when we made a game on scratch because we kind of had to teach ourselves and it was a bit self-explanatory. I ended up making a game I really enjoyed and was proud to be able to say that I made that. One thing I do differently now is I write pseudocode on a piece of paper prior to making the program this helps me do a checklist as I complete the program. I feel like the way I learn best is one-on-one teaching because I usually have a lot of questions when I'm going through a program and if there is someone there who can answer them and explain them to me I can easily get the hang of it. This class has become increasingly more difficult and hard to keep up with I feel like we rush through things without properly explaining how or why or when to use them.
Touch on an "a-ha!" moment that you encountered in the course; a moment when suddenly a concept that you struggled with made sense. If you have yet to encounter or experience such a moment, discuss why. One aha moment I had was when we were doing the hello world program and I say the inner working of such a magnificent work of programming art. Talk about each of these with a classmate, and compare notes. How have your experiences differed and how have they aligned? I have compared this essay was one of my friends we both agree that this class is very difficult and sometimes doesn't make sense we also both agree that things could be explained more and we move on before everyone even understands the problem
